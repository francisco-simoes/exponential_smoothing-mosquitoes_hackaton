# Time series and Exponential smoothing

A *time series* is a set of random variables {}

It is common to try to split a time series into three components: the *trend* (T), *seasonal* (S) and *error* (E) components. 
These components can be combined in different ways.
For example by simply adding them, so that y = T + S + E, or by assuming multiplicative seasonality but additive error, so that y = T x S + E.

Given a time series
